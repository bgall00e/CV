  <h3>Course Development</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Human Physiology Laboratory (University) – As laboratory coordinator I was responsible for maintaining lab operations and assignments used in the course. The lab exercises promoted conceptual thinking, data analysis, and enhanced the exposure
      of scientific literature to the students. </li><br>
    <li>Anatomy and Physiology (11th grade) – I designed this course to expose students to the structure as well as the underlying physiological mechanisms of humans, fish, birds, and other organisms at various levels of organization. Students were
      assessed through written exams and quizzes, labs, and practicals. </li><br>
    <li>Biology and AP (9th grade) – I developed a full year class with the course goal of growing students’ interest and curiosity in science. My class focused on the living systems of our planet from “small to big”. Students were assessed through
      weekly quizzes, creative story telling (ex. photosynthesis comic strip), take home tests, labs, and quarterly essays. </li><br>
    <li>Principles of Sustainability (7th and 8th grade) – This course is designed to cover origins of life on Earth, climate change, fossil fuels, renewable energy, nuclear energy, overpopulation, GMO/CRISPR, pollution, disease, carbon offsets,
      globalization, and sustainability. </li><br>
    <li>Oceanography (12th grade)- A semester long science elective developed to expose high school seniors to the physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms that dictate ocean behavior. In addition, students learned of technology used to
      navigate, map, measure, and sail the oceans. Project-based learning such as model ship building, cartography, and self-sustaining aquarium design were implemented throughout the course. </li><br>
    <li>Psychology- A yearlong science elective that explored the physical and chemical pathways of the central and peripheral nervous system, life span development stages of the brain, social organization, cognition, personality, and emotions as
      they pertain to psychology. Students were required to read literature associated with experimental design, collect and analyze their own data, and produce their own podcast! </li><br>
    <li>Forensic Science (8th-12th grade) - A semester long course that explores the methods used to collect, preserve and analyze evidence during the course of an investigation. During the semester students will also hear from licensed
      investigators, attorneys and detectives on their experiences in the field of forensic science, laboratories and the courtroom. </li><br>
    <li>App. Development – A semester long course that focuses on the basics of JavaScript and Swift programming language. Skills will include: setting up the development environment, mastering fundamental data types and operators, and building the
      visual interface using Xcode. Once the basics have been mastered, students will work to reverse engineer basic app types to understand complex actions and then use those skills to build and launch their own apps. </li><br>
    <li>Python programming - Python Programming is a foundation class for further work in computer science. Python is a modern, elegant, high level scripting language. Although it can be used for scientific programming, web servers, and a variety of
      other purposes, students will primarily be creating simple projects that include program design, boolean logic, calculations, debugging, input/output, graphics and animation.</li><br>
